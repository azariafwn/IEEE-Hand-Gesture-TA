\section{Limitations and Future Work}
While the system demonstrates successful proof-of-concept, several limitations exist:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Network Jitter: The reliance on HTTP over Wi-Fi introduces unpredictable delays. Future work should explore lightweight protocols like MQTT or dedicated wireless standards like Zigbee or ESP-NOW to reduce latency and jitter \cite{chen_wifi}.
    \item Discrete Control Only: Currently, the system only supports binary states (ON/OFF). Developing continuous gesture recognition (e.g., rotating hand to dim lights) would enhance functionality.
    \item Hardware Integration: The current setup uses modular wiring. Designing a custom PCB would improve durability and form factor for commercial deployment.
\end{enumerate}
